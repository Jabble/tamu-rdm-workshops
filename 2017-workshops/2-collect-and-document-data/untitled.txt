Don't want to link out to USAID publications repository, because it isn't clean

Matt will followithup on some smaller things

Data from 4 CG partners. Stored in different place online. Want to find a way to have the data within dataverse without replicating what they've done.
- Trying to make two dataverses talk to each other. So tht we can link to datasets in the harvard datasets (IFPRI and ILRI) IWMI has their own data repository where they're storing. Want datasets to have a presence in their space.
- North Carolina A&T not making data available, and could get access to ILSSI dataverse to submit data. Might want a call to show off dataverse.

Phone call with USAID on Tuesday to talk about the data. Oso binyum. Lady in USAID who is in charge on the data managements side. Data steward.
