# Using data repositories
- Repositories
- Finding and accessing data sources

## The need for preservation
- During your research, you will need to make sure your data are not lost, stolen, or corrupted. 
- The storage we have discussed so far can be considered workable over the course of your project, and into the medium term. 
- Perhaps up to 5 years or so after your project. 

- Some researchers want to share their data with the public or their research community; 
- some want to be able to link their data set with a published paper that used that data; 
- others want to obtain a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) for their data set to use and cite in a publication; 
- some are required to by their funder, their institution, or their publisher to maintain their data in a repository. 

### External requirements
Your funder, publisher, and/or institution are likely to have data retention policies. 
Meaning that you will need to safely store your data for a certain period after your project is complete. 
And you may need to make your data publically available, in which case, it needs to continue to be maintained. 


For Texas A&M University, the minimum research data retention period is **3 years**. 

Standard Administrative Procedure 15.99.03.M1.03 "The Responsible Stewardship of Research Data" [PDF](http://rules-saps.tamu.edu/PDFs/15.99.03.M1.03.pdf)

One of the most challenging aspects of data management is in understanding how long data needs to be maintained. Retention periods serve to help researchers understand how long they are required to keep their data in order to comply with the terms of their grant. Data retention requirements may be complex, and at times ambiguous, so it is important to understand the retention requirements of each of your projects’ sponsors, as well as storage requirements for special record types (e.g., tissue samples, laboratory notebooks, and proprietary databases, etc.), and policies and services of your parent institution. 

### Long-term usefulness
Or you may want to preserve the data for a longer period of time due to some other value. 

Beyond any externally imposed requirements, you should think about the long-term usefulness of your data. 

If the data are from an experiment that you anticipate will be repeatable more quickly, inexpensively, and accurately as technology progresses, 
you may want to store it for a relatively brief period. 

If the data consists of observations made outside the laboratory that can never be repeated, you may wish to store it indefinitely.

## Data repositories
- Tools for sharing and preserving data made available by different groups and institutions.

1. Institutional repository (“IR”): connected to the researcher’s institution. 
2. Disciplinary repository (“DR”): discipline specific and often operated by a professional organization, a consortium of researchers, or some similar group 
	- (e.g., Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). 
3. Open Repository (“OR”): allows researchers from different disciplines to deposit and make their data available.


### Finding a data repository
Science-Recommended repsitories

You should select a repository or archive for your data based on the long-term security offered and the ease of discovery and access by colleagues in your field. There are two common types of repository to look for:

Discipline specific: accepts data in a particluar field or of a particluar type (e.g., GenBank accepts nucleotide sequence data)
Institutional: accepts data of any type produced within the institution that maintains it (e.g., the University of California's Merritt)

A searchable and browsable list of repositories can be found at these websites:

re3data.org: a REgistry of REsearch data REpositories
Data Repositories in the Open Access Directory: a list of repositories hosted by Simmons College

FAIRSharing: a directory of life sciences databases and reporting standards


## Repository considerations
- Access
	- Does the repository allow for access restrictions, esp. for sensitive data? Some do.
- Permanent Identifiers
	- DOIs to cite and link to the data
- Embargoes
	- Can you add an embargo period?
- Licensing options
	- Open Data Commons:  legally binding tools to govern the use of data sets. Using a combination of copyright and contractual standards, 
		- they have created three standard licenses that one can use in conjunction with data projects.
	- Creative Commons: a library of standardized licenses, and some of them apply to data and databases. 
		- The ODC-By license, for example, is the equivalent of a Creative Commons Attribution license (CC BY). CC BY licenses, however, require copyright ownership of the underlying work, 
		- whereas the ODC-By license applies to works not protected by copyright (such as factual data)
	- You can also specify terms of use, funding agencies may provide templates.
- Depositing Data: 
	- self-deposit 
	- mediated deposit
- Repository policies for
	- Curation 
		- Any cleaning and review?
	- Data disposal
		- Which data sets are worthy of permanent retention/archiving? 
		- Which data sets should be disposed of once their retention period has been met? 
		- What criteria are used? 
		- Who decides?

### Tips for using a data repository
Decide what you want to share:
This can be a subset or partciular version
Perhaps only the clean data that are relevant to a publication.

Choose file formats that last: 
The file format in which you keep your data (and documentation) is a primary factor in the ability to use data in the future. 
Plan for both hardware and software obsolescence. 

Remember the documentation: 
Begin to document your data at the very beginning of your research project and continue throughout the project.
Include relevant documentation files (READMEs) so others can interpret the data.

Consider ownership and privacy: 
Make sure that you have considered the implications of sharing data in terms of copyright, IP ownership, and subject confidentiality. 
Decide what licenses you may want to attach to data, or usage agreements to write.

Follow metadata tips and standards:
For creating a metadata record for the data you submit.
Such as:

1. Consistent data entry is important.  Review your metadata for typos, extraneous punctuation, and any inconsistencies in fielded entry, such as putting an author into a title field.

2.	Avoid extraneous punctuation as it can create retrieval issues. 

3.	Avoid most abbreviations. It is fine to use common or accepted abbreviations (such as "cm" for "centimeters") as long as you document the expectation, and are consistent about it.

4.	In general, capitalize the first word (of a title, for example) and proper names (place, personal and corporate names) and subject terms only. Capitalize content in the description field according to normal rules of writing. Do not enter content in all caps except in the case of acronyms.

5.	Use templates and macros when possible.  It may be that certain data elements will always be the same.  In those cases try to automate the entry as it cuts down on errors.

6.	Extract pre-existing metadata from your sources whenever possible.  Information about pictures and word documents can be embedded within the resource itself and extracted for quick population of templates.

7.	Keep a data dictionary of the elements, technical standards, and controlled vocabularies you use in your project.

8.	Always use an established metadata standard. Your discipline probably already has a best practices metadata standard specific to your research needs.
