# The research data lifecycle
<!-- Last revised: 2018-04-30

Revised by: Anna Dabrowski -->

Learning objectives:

- Participants recognize that research data have a "lifetime" or "lifecycle."

## Introduction
*Hand out pens and sheets of paper with sticky notes attached*

In this series we will think about managing research data over time. 

For this section, we'll talk about the "life" of research data to get an overview of data management concerns at different points during – and after – a research project. 

## The life of data
The “life”, “lifetime” or lifecycle” of research data covers the time from which a project is conceived and data gathering is planned, until the point when data are deleted or lost. 

When we discuss this lifecycle, we’ll break it down into data management activities you will do at different parts of the research process. 

You can do this by thinking about what happens to your data in between milestones like these. You will work with data in steps between the time:

1. The research project is proposed.
	...
2. Research papers are published.
	...
3. The research project ends.
	...
5. Someone wants to access and reuse the data.

## Diagrams as a tool
Diagrams – like the two empty flow charts you see here – are a great tool for thinking about the progress of your data over time. 

![Empty lifecycle flow charts](https://github.com/Jabble/tamu-rdm-workshops/blob/master/visuals/diagrams/empty-data-life-diagram.jpg)

These two diagrams are empty, but:

- Each box can be filled in to show a data management stage as your research progresses.
- The arrows indicate the direction in which you move from one stage to another.

Before your research:

- Simple flow charts like these will give you an overview of the steps you expect the data in your project to go through, 
- and help you anticipate how the data will need to be managed at each step. 

Later in your research:

- As you work with your data, 
- more detailed flow charts can be valuable for effectively visualizing the specific decisions and actions you take to process data, and the results of those actions.

## Exercise
Take a few minutes to think about your research and how you expect it to progress. You can think about an existing, or anticipated, research project.

You should have sheets of paper with your very own little yellow boxes (sticky notes) in front of you.  

*Demo using sticky notes on white board or wall*

- Use the little sticky notes to represent steps in the life of your data, 
- go ahead and write the steps directly on the sticky notes, 
- and arrange them in the way you expect to move from one step to the next. 

What steps do you anticipate taking (or may have already taken) with data?

*Demo writing on sticky notes*

If it helps, you can start with step one being "gather research data." As you write your general steps think about what your actions will be as part of the step. For example, when you gather research data: 

- What form will your data take?
	- Audio or video recordings?
	- Written responses?
	- Outputs in a digital spreadsheet?

- How will you collect them?
	Create and distribute a questionnaire?
	Write code and run computational models?
	Ask participants to join experiments?
	Use instruments to measure physical phenomena?
	
Continue to think through what you will need to do to the data before results can be published, before the project is over, and before you can share or delete your data.

As you think about your own research and how you will work with data, your diagrams can:

- take this sort of form, 
- they may also be simpler,
- or more complicated.

I'll give you 10 minutes or so to think and make diagrams before we talk about them. If you have any questions, just raise a hand.

There are no right or wrong answers.

*Wait 10 minutes before asking participants to share diagrams*

This can be a tough thing to think through before we've talked more about the steps these diagrams often include. 

Since you may have different experiences with research, I'd like to get an idea of how you currently think about your working with data.

*If the exercise is unclear to a participant try the hint below, or use it as an explanation after the exercise.*

### Hint/Explanation 
For context, you can think about how the data changes. So, you:

- collect data and then you have **Raw data** 
- due to some actions this data becomes **Processed data** 
- then you start taking a look at the data have **Analyzed data** 
- You may need to do a bit more work with it before the data are **Finalized/published data**

*Demo making and organizing steps on whiteboard or wall with a simplified hypothetical example*

To illustrate using a simplified hypothetical research question:

Water temperatures in The Gulf of Mexico are now significantly warmer than in previous years. Is there evidence to link this to global warming?  

**Raw data** - These are the data generated during the research project.

- Raw data in our hypothetical research question might be daily measurements of temperature in the Gulf. 
- Raw data coincides with the **data collection** step of the research data life cycle.

**Processed data** - How can the raw data be made useful/manipulable?

- Gulf temperature data may become processed by removing clearly erroneous temperature measurements from the data set, 
- and entering the remaining temperatures into a spreadsheet for manipulation and analysis. 
- Processed data coincides with the **data processing** step of the research data life cycle.

**Analyzed data** – What do the data tell us?  Is it significant?  How so?  

- Daily Gulf temperature data may be analyzed by finding average temperatures, looking at seasonal fluctuations, and generating graphs that demonstrate these changes.
- Analyzed data coincides with the **data analysis** step of the research data lifecycle.

**Finalized/published data** – How does the data support your research question? 

- A plot of average Gulf temperatures for 2018 may show statistically significant differences when compared to the same data from 1913 and 1963.
- Finalized/published data coincides with a few sections of the research data lifecycle including **data preservation** and **data reuse**.

Note: this Gulf temperature scenario is a very simplified example.  In many cases:

- Raw data from different sources will be collected, combined, and analyzed in support of a research question.  
- Data does not always flow simply from raw to published stages in a single, linear direction. 
- For example, raw data from one experiment may be repurposed for analysis in another.  
- Processed or raw data may also be subjected to multiple rounds of different methods of analysis.

## DataONE lifecycle diagram
This is a very general data “lifecycle” or “lifetime” diagram that informs this workshop series. 

The diagram was developed by DataONE (The Data Observation Network for Earth), one of many organizations promoting good practices in data management.

![DataOne Data Lifecycle](https://github.com/Jabble/tamu-rdm-workshops/blob/master/visuals/diagrams/dataone-data_lifecycle-diagram.png)

The full DataONE diagram has eight components or stages, starting at the top and following the arrows, and each has it's own management issues:

- Plan: description of the data that will be compiled, and how the data will be managed and made accessible throughout its lifetime.
- Collect: observations are made either by hand or with sensors or other instruments and the data are placed a into digital form.
- Assure: the quality of the data are assured through checks and inspections.
- Describe: data are accurately and thoroughly described, relevant information about the data (metadata) is written using the appropriate standards.
- Preserve: data are submitted to an appropriate long-term archive or repository.
- Discover: potentially useful data are located and obtained, along with the relevant information about the data (metadata).
- Integrate: data from disparate sources are combined to form one homogeneous set of data that can be readily analyzed.
- Analyze: data are analyzed.

As I mentioned, this diagram is generic.

## DataONE lifecycle diagram [continued]
The life of your data will be much more specific for your research. 
This could be one way that you work with data over the course of your project.

As a graduate student, you may also only be responsible for specific components of the lifecycle. 

Nonetheless, you should be aware that the life of research data involves many components. 
For which, you, or someone else, is likely to be responsible. 

## University of California, Santa Cruz
This lifecycle diagram was developed by the Libraries at University of California in Santa Cruz. 
It describes the life of data a little differently, through actions.

![University of California, Santa Cruz Research Data Management Lifecycle](https://github.com/Jabble/tamu-rdm-workshops/blob/master/visuals/diagrams/uc-data_lifecycle-diagram.png)

- Starts with writing a data management plan as an action.
- Then shows data storage is it's own management concern during data collection, description, and analysis.
- Moves on to data retention, promotion, and search and reuse as actions.

## University of Virginia
This diagram from the University of Virginia looks more linear, but also loops back on itself.

![University of Virginia Steps in the Data Life Cycle](https://github.com/Jabble/tamu-rdm-workshops/blob/master/visuals/diagrams/uvirginia-data_lifecycle-diagram.png)

- It starts from writing a proposal and starting a project.
- To the data-intensive steps of data collection, analysis, and sharing.

One thing that it shows, which the other diagrams omit, is how you may reuse the data you analyze and conduct different analyses or need to iterate in order to answer your research questions.

Then it shows how the life of data may continue after a project ends:

- Through data archiving by the creator and discovery by others.

<!-- ## DCC data curation lifecycle
The lifecycle focuses specifically on curation activities.

- Conceptualise
- Create or Receive
- Appraise and Select
- Ingest
- Preservation Action
- Store
- Access, Use and Reuse
- Transform -->

## Discussion
*Ask participants for their opinion of their diagrams compared to these*

Everyone describe the lifecycle a little differently. 

Now that you’ve seen a few different overviews of how the life and management of research data progresses over time:

- How does your diagram compare?
- Would you change anything about the diagram you made?
- Did you miss anything when you were thinking about your own data? 
- Maybe the lifecycles will account for something you didn’t think about? 
- Maybe they will be too general, and you included more detail?

These are generic and written from the perspective of librarians and data curators. 

- In particular they focus on the use and re-usability of the data, and this is an essential component of good data management. 
- The life of your data will be specific for your research. 
- Ultimately, there isn’t a right or wrong way to outline the life of your data, 
- but there will be common stages that you can expect to go through and think about managing your data in these stages.

## Conclusion
We covered components of the research data lifecycle and how they can be diagramed to help think about the progress of a research project and data management activities.
