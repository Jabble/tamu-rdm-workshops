# Data documentation
## Objectives
- Metadata, codebooks, etc.
- tech is changing quickly, e.g. DNA sequencing, and new analyses coming quickly, good documentation is important

##
Maintain dataset provenance
Document transformations
Beware of accidental duplication

Review metadata for compatibility of context, methods, and meaning
For what purpose was the data collected?
How was the data collected?
It is sensible to combine these datasets?


Ensure compatibility
Convert to common units
Choose appropriate numeric precision
Evaluate and standardize missing value codes

Document all assumptions
What assumptions underlie the original datasets?
What assumptions did you make in combining the datasets?


Recognize that you are creating a new dataset
Revisit the data life cycle to ensure the new dataset is properly documented, validated, and preserved

Use reproducible workflows
Enable transparency and reproducibility in the integration process
Ensure others understand and can evaluate your decision making process.
Automate the integration as much as possible
Especially when integrating many datasets or large datasets
