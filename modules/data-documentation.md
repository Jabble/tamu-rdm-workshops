# Data documentation
## Objectives
- Notes
- Metadata, codebooks, etc.
- tech is changing quickly, e.g. DNA sequencing, and new analyses coming quickly, good documentation is important

## Introduction
Plan management -> **Collect and store**  -> Assure quality -> **Analyze and present** -> **Share and preserve**

##
Maintain dataset provenance
Document transformations
Beware of accidental duplication

Review metadata for compatibility of context, methods, and meaning
For what purpose was the data collected?
How was the data collected?
It is sensible to combine these datasets?


Ensure compatibility
Convert to common units
Choose appropriate numeric precision
Evaluate and standardize missing value codes

Document all assumptions
What assumptions underlie the original datasets?
What assumptions did you make in combining the datasets?


Recognize that you are creating a new dataset
Revisit the data life cycle to ensure the new dataset is properly documented, validated, and preserved

Use reproducible workflows
Enable transparency and reproducibility in the integration process
Ensure others understand and can evaluate your decision making process.
Automate the integration as much as possible
Especially when integrating many datasets or large datasets

## Lab notebooks
Why?

- To provide yourself with a record of how your data were collected, organized and processed. Yes, you will forget if you don’t write it down.
- To provide yourself with a central & physical location for protocols, results, and general happenings.
- To encourage a thoughtful process. The act of writing things out forces you to explore and clarify ideas.
- To enable continuity in the face of unexpected events.
- To establish a legal and scientific provenance (historical record) of your work

How? Analog, digital, mixed

- A notebook with a stitched binding.
- Don’t be temped by the “carbon copy” types.
- A larger size is generally better, but preferences vary.
- Better quality paper is more expensive, but is worth it.
- A notebook with pre-numbered pages is also worth it. 
- The kind that lays flat when open is nice to have.
- Electronic notebooks (ELNs) are hugely variable and often discipline-specific. Do your homework if you want to go that route.

What?

- Notes on all discussions and thoughts on the experimental/research goals
- Protocols for experiments or for acquiring data (if using 2ndary data). Tape in printed versions if you want to.
- Provide justifications for method, source of data (how did they generate the data?).
- Annotate all calculations so that anyone could understand what you did. Remember units!
- Provide full details on experimental/research organisms/subjects.
- If performing lab experiments w/reagents, list details like manufacturer, batch, etc.
- Record equipment details. 
- Capture field, laboratory, or interview conditions.
- Your personal description may be relevant. Maybe. If it could be, write it down.
-  Write the names of people who have assisted you, for future acknowledgement.
- Make quick drawings set-ups, locations, etc.
- Take photos and paste them in.
- Record file names of data, where they are stored and backed up. 
- Get into the habit of making daily entries – ALWAYS date your entries, including YEAR.
- If you record log data into a digital spreadsheet, record the event in your notebook.
- Detail your mistakes.
- Use military time, or at least AM/PM
- All entries should be un-obscured by attached graphs, data sheets, photographs, etc.
- When you include photographs, graphs, product labels, etc., use glue to cleanly and permanently attach all edges. Do not use tape.
- Avoid making entries that are unrelated to your project.
- Include the full names and contact information for all collaborators
- At the conclusion of your experiment, write or print out a full directory of all electronic files that relate to your experiment.
- Describe the locations of all computer media, data binders, seeds, samples, etc.. 
- Typically, the laboratory notebook should stay in the laboratory where the experiments were conducted (i.e., with your mentor or employer).
- Digital cameras are really cheap, so if you do expensive, important science I recommend that you have 1 camera per project. At the end of each work day the researcher should take a photograph of each page.
