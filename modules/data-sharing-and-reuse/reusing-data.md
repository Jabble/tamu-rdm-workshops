## 
When reusing datasets you will need to rely on the information provided by the creators. This includes considering the terms of use (see lgal and ethical) as well as the  metadata and documentation provided by the data creators to assess if the data meet your needs. You may also need to apply transformations in order to use the dataset of combine the data with your own.

AVAILABLE CODE BOOKS AND DATA SETS

Below are codebooks (as pdf files) and data sets (as .csv files) for each of five data sets that you can use in this course and throughout the data analysis fundamentals specialization. Alternately, you are welcome to use a data set of your own. During week 1, you should view the codebooks. For week 2, you will be downloading a data set of your choosing.

The U.S. National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) is a survey designed to determine the magnitude of alcohol use and psychiatric disorders in the U.S. population. It is a representative sample of the non-institutionalized population 18 years and older.

2. The Mars Craters Study, presents a global database that includes over 300,000 Mars craters 1 km or larger that were created between 4.2 and 3.8 billion years ago during a period of heavy bombardment (i.e. impacts of asteroids, proto-planets, and comets).

3. The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (AddHealth) is a representative school-based survey of adolescents in grades 7-12 in the United States. The Wave 1 survey focuses on factors that may influence adolescentsâ€™ health and risk behaviors, including personal traits, families, friendships, romantic relationships, peer groups, schools, neighborhoods, and communities. Check out the AddHealth Code Book Index to see a list of the topics addressed in each codebook section.

4. This portion of the GapMinder data includes one year of numerous country-level indicators of health, wealth and development.

5. The Outlook on Life Survey (OOL) was designed to study political and social attitudes in the United States. The project included two surveys fielded between August and December 2012 using a sample from an Internet panel. The target population was comprised of four groups: African American/Black males aged 18 and older, African American/Black females aged 18 and older, White/other race males aged 18 and older, and White/other race females aged 18 older

The OLL data have been generously made available to us by the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). These data are restricted to download and use only during this Coursera specialization. OOL files should be deleted following the completion of the capstone experience or at the end of the last assignment that you choose to complete. Data files for this survey should not be shared or re-posted at any time. Your use of this data set indicates your acceptance of these terms. Details on ICPSR membership and full access to their data archive is available at http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/membership/index.html.




Ensure compatibility
Convert to common units
Choose appropriate numeric precision
Evaluate and standardize missing value codes

Document all assumptions
What assumptions underlie the original datasets?
What assumptions did you make in combining the datasets?


Recognize that you are creating a new dataset
Revisit the data life cycle to ensure the new dataset is properly documented, validated, and preserved


Enable transparency and reproducibility in the integration process
Ensure others understand and can evaluate your decision making process.
Automate the integration as much as possible
Especially when integrating many datasets or large datasets

Consider the compatibility of the data you are integrating

Best Practice: 
The integration of multiple data sets from different sources requires that they be compatible. Methods used to create the data should be considered early in the process, to avoid problems later during attempts to integrate data sets. Note that just because data can be integrated does not necessarily mean that they should be, or that the final product can meet the needs of the study. Where possible, clearly state situations or conditions where it is and is not appropriate to use your data, and provide information (such as software used and good metadata) to make integration easier.

Description Rationale: 
When using integrated data sets, it is crucial that the data are comparable and compatible to avoid mistakes in analyses and interpretation.

Related Best Practices: 
Confirm a match between data and their description in metadata
Document steps used in data processing
Define the data model

Examples: 
Water-quality data collected by two separate agencies may be thematically similar but may have been sampled using completely different methods. Differences in such water-quality sample methods can include equipment, sampling method protocol, and lab analysis procedures. Analysis performed on integrated water-quality data that were collected using completely different methods would likely result in questionable results.
