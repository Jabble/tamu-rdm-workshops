# File organization
## Objectives
- Compare file naming conventions.
- Design a file naming convention.

## Introduction
Plan management -> **Collect and store**  -> Assure quality -> Analyze and present -> **Share and preserve**

In this module, we'll look at organizing data with accessibility in mind. The goal is for you to be aware of organizational strategies that can help you focus on working with your data, rather than trying to find files. 

Professor Jeff Haywood at the University of Edinburgh on the importance of good file management [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2jcOJOFUZg)


"Naming records consistently, logically and in a predictable way will distinguish similar records from one another at a glance, and by doing so will facilitate the storage and retrieval of records, which will enable users to browse file names more effectively and efficiently. Naming records according to agreed conventions should also make file naming easier for colleagues because they will not have to ‘re-think’ the process each time." - University of Edinburgh Records Management Section

At the start of a research project it is easy to believe that you'll remember what name you gave to a file and where you put it. 

However once your research gets underway there may be multiple files in various formats, multiple versions, websites, citations, blogs, articles, methodologies, notes, spreadsheets, etc. all relating to your research. 

Trying to find a data file that you need which has been stored or named incorrectly or inaccurately can be both frustrating and a waste of valuable time. 

Thus good file management practises are required to enable you to identify, locate and use your research data files efficiently and effectively. 

Good file management practises such as following group filenaming protocols are also required should you wish to share your files with others in a shared filespace.

## Basic Directory and File Naming Conventions

Research data files and folders need to be labelled and organised in a systematic way so that they are both identifiable and accessible for current and future users. The benefits of consistent data file labelling are:

- Data files are distinguishable from each other within their containing folder

- Data file naming prevents confusion when multiple people are working on shared files

- Data files are easier to locate and browse

- Data files can be retrieved not only by the creator but by other users

- Data files can be sorted in logical sequence

- Data files are not accidentally overwritten or deleted

- Different versions of data files can be identified

- If data files are moved to another storage platform their names will retain useful context 


There are three main criteria to consider regarding the naming and labelling of research data files, namely:
Organisation - important for future access and retrieval, and needs to take into account the file naming constraints of the system where the file is located

Context - this could include content specific or descriptive information, independent of where the data are stored

Consistency - choose a naming convention and ensure that the rules are followed systematically by always including the same information (such as date and time) in the same order (e.g. YYYYMMDD)

- MANTRA "Organizaing data" [module](http://mantra.edina.ac.uk/organisingdata/)

These are rough guidelines to follow to help manage your data files in case you don't already have your own internal conventions. When organizing files, the top-level directory/folder should include:

Project title
Unique identifier (Guidance on persistent external identifiers is available)
Date (yyyy or yyyy.mm.dd)
The sub-directory structure should have clear, documented naming conventions. Separate files or directories could apply, for example, to each run of an experiment, each version of a dataset, and/or each person in the group.

Reserve the 3-letter file extension for the file format, such as .txt, .pdf, or .csv.
Identify the activity or project in the file name.
Identify separate versions of files and datasets using file or directory naming conventions. It can quickly become difficult to identify the 'correct' version of a file.
Record all changes to a file no matter how small. Discard obsolete versions after making backups.

Naming files sensible things is good for you and for your computers. Without structured information, our lives would be much poorer. There's one necessary condition from which an organization schemes can develop. 

**Be consistent.** 

Have conventions for your:

1. Directory structure
2. Folder names
3. File names

## Directory structure
I'll share my directory structure and file naming schemes I use with you.

### Folder and file naming conventions
There are also a number of common elements that should be considered when developing a file naming strategy, including:

- Version number 

- Date of creation

- Name of creator

- Description of content

- Name of research team/department associated with the data

- Publication date

- Project number

Do not use generic file names that may conflict when moved from one location to another. Ensure filenames are independent of location and if you work on more than one computer ensure that your files are synchronised.

File names should outlast the file creator who originally named the file.

Consider how scalable your file naming policy needs to be e.g. if you want to include the project number, don't limit your project number to two digits, or you can only have ninety nine projects.

File and folder naming conventions are key to maintaining well-organised electronic directory and drive structures.

A filename is the chief identifier for a research data file. In most cases the policy for naming a file is left to individuals or to groups of individuals. 

There are a number of easy-to-follow rules that should be followed when naming data files:

Keep file names short and relevant - generally about 25 characters is a sufficient length to capture enough descriptive information for naming a data file

Do not use special characters in a filename such as : & * % $ £ ] { ! @ as these are often used for specific tasks in different operating systems

Use underscores instead of full-stops or spaces because, like special characters, these are parsed differently on different systems.

The filename should include as much descriptive information that will assist identification independent of where it is stored.

If including dates, format them consistently.

Do not assume that the software application or instrument uses case dependency when naming or renaming files within the aforementioned utility - assume that TANGO, Tango and tango are the same, even thought some file systems may consider them as different.

Where possible, use file extensions (often defaults) to accurately reflect the software environment in which the file was created and the physical format of the file. Eg use .por for SPSS portable files, .xls or .xlsx for Excel files, .ssd or .sas7bdat as appropriate for SAS files, .txt for text files, etc.

Naming files by chronology - if using a date, use the format Year-Month-Day: YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM or YYYY-YYYY. This will maintain chronological order of your files.

The goal of having folder and file naming conventions is primarily for easy identification and sorting. This way you can quickly navigate to the right place and identify the file or files you need at a glance.

Remember, you can use other means to save more information about your files and the data within them. We discussed this in more depth in the "Data Documentation" portion. This can be done inside the file itself or in a seperate README file that describes your file naming convention.

**Tips for constructing names**

- Be descriptive
- Include relevant information for identification
- Always include the same informational components
- Retain the order of components
- Keep names under 32 characters
- Avoid special characters
- Use '-' or '_' instead of ' '
- limit '.' to one before the file extension 

When constructing files, the following components are often relevant. Use them alone or in a combination that suits your needs.

|informational component | example | tip |
|----------|----------|----------|
|Name | project name or research data| Keep it simple|
|Sequential numbering | Run of experiment |Include leading zeros|
|Dates | Use [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format for dates to retain the order| |
|Unique identifier | A subject id for files, grant number in the folder name| |
|Experimental Condition | such as lab instrument, solvent, temperature, etc.| |


### Strategies and trade-offs
Organising data with Professor Richard Rodger from University of Edinburgh [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhxVmYtKqIY 

Order the components of a name to organize your file by:

Date
Type
Subject
Sequential number (forced order)

## Batch renaming
Although all operating systems have in-built tools for managing files, there are software tools that can organise research data files and folders in a consistent and automated way through batch renaming (also known as mass file renaming, bulk renaming). Batch renaming software exists for most operating systems.

There are many situations in which batch renaming may be useful, such as:

where images from digital cameras are automatically assigned base filenames consisting of sequential numbers

where proprietary software or instrumentation generate crude, default or multiple filenames

where files are transferred from a system that supports spaces and/or non-English characters in filenames to one that doesn't (or vice versa). Batch renaming software can be used to substitute such characters with acceptable ones.

Examples of bulk renaming tools include:


Windows:
Ant Renamer (www.antp.be/software/renamer)

RenameIT (sourceforge.net/prpjects/renameit)

Bulk Rename Utility (www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/)

Mac:
Renamer 5 (for Mac) (renamer.com/)

Name Changer (mrrsoftware.com/namechanger/)

Linux:
GNOME Commander (www.nongnu.org/gcmd/)

Unix:
The use of the grep command to search for regular expressions
