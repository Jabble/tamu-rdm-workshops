# Data gathering
## Objectives
- Identify types of data and appropriate formats
- Use/Design a file naming convention

## Introduction
- Keep organized 
	- Easier to find files
	- Focus on your working with your data


## Types of data
Data are often divided into quantitive and qualitative. Quantitative data are expressed numerically, are often (but not always) continuous and measurable. Qualitative data are categorical data expressed in natural language. 

### Exercise: Qualitative or Quantitative?
- Counts indicating the number of occurances.
- Sport preferences (football, basketball, volleyball, hockey, ping pong)
- Responses on a scale of agreement (strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree).
- Social security numbers.

### Categories
What you intend to study will infotm the data types you gather and work with 
**Observational data** are captured in situ. Common examples: Survey results, sensor readings.
**Experimental data** are collected under controlled conditions. Common examples: gene sequences, spectroscopy, cell counts. 
**Compiled data** are integrated from multiple sources and can be of many types. Common examples: compiled databases, 3D models, geospatial data. 
**Derived data** are created from existing sources. Common examples: text and data mining.
**Simulation data** are results of using a model to study a system. Common examples: climate models, economic models.
**Reference data** are published (possibly peer-reviewed) or curated datasets informing research. Common examples: gene sequence databanks, chemical structures, census data, spatial data portals. 


### Exercise: Identify your data
- Do you have experience with conducting research in the past? What have you done?
- What type of data to you have past experience gathering, working with, or plan to gather in your graduate research?
- Can that data be recreated? What are the problems or limitations with recreating it, if it is lost?


## Formats of data
Data formats are often closely tied to data types. Example: Qualitative, tabular, experimental data can be encoded in many formats.

|Format                            | Extension| Library of Congress description|

## Format transformation

## Directory structure and file naming conventions
This may belong in data gathering

## Spreadsheets
- pros/cons
- some tools

## Databases

## Areas
- analog and digital data gathering
- data discovery
- data entry and manipulation (DataONE)
- file formats and transformations
