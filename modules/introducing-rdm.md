# Introducing Research Data Management
## Objectives
- Understand the purpose of Research Data Management training.

## Why is "data management" a thing?
- Personal efficiency
	- If you aren't already, you'll soon be busy. Or you'll just want to spend some of your time NOT working.
	- Thinking and working this way will help you be more effective throughout your PhD and reduce the amount of work at the end.
- Happy advisors
	- Understanding these concepts will make your advisors happy because they'll be able to easily see what your doing and spend less time teaching you.
- The future
	- Good practices will benefit you and the community. 
	- Depending on how you share your data it will be reusable, by you, your advisor, your lab, and/or the research community in the future. 
	- You can get credit for your work and...
	- The time will come when you've entirely forgotten what you did that one week in the 2nd year of your PhD and don't want someone to emailing you to ask about it 5 years later.
