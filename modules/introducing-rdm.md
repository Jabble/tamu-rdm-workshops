# Introducing Research Data Management
## Objectives
- Understand the purpose of Research Data Management training.
- Understand the the scope of the workshop series.

## Introduction
My name is Anna Dabrowski. I'm the Data Management Librarian at the Texas A&M University Libraries. This is a new position, which means I'm working on expanding our data services here at the Libraries and this workshop series is one way for us to do that. Your subject librarians are also an excellent resource for you, and they may be able t

### Student introductions
*(Etherpad)[]*

1. Your name
2. What do you study or intend to study? What is your area of research?
3. Do already have, or work with, data?
4. Why did you sign up for this workshop series?

## About the workshop series
This workshop series is a 6-part introduction to Research Data Management. We will spend 2.5 hours in each workshop, with two 10-minute breaks. 

Each week we will cover different topics, with the goal of helping you identify data management practices and tools that will improve your research and your graduate experience.


- Bring a laptop if you can. If not, you may borrow one from the library.
- Since it's late in the evening, we'll have snacks during our breaks.

### Our agreement 
By participating in this workshop series, we have an agreement. 

Please be aware that we have a diverse group of participants with different experiences and who are dealing with different subject matter. This is a general introduction, with no prerequisites. The series is broad rather than deep. Some topics are likely to be more familiar to you than others, and we may also cover topics that aren't directly applicable to your specific research area. 

This said, I'm eager to get your feedback and direct the material based on your interest. I would like you all to feel welcome to share your experience, and to express your thoughts, comments, and questions.

Along these lines, there is one rule:

**Individuals who behave in a manner that shows indent to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort to others will be asked to leave.**

There is no grade. This is a chance for you to gain familiarity, practice, ask questions, and be silly (if you want). You should be aware that exercises and hands-on activities are key elements of the workshops, and active participation is expected.

If you prefer not to participate, this is fine. But, I ask that you please give up your seat to someone on the wait list. There is a lot of great material available online that covers data management. I'm happy to send you all the resources for this series where you can watch online modules and read on your own. If you're choosing to sit here, then you're choosing to join in a group conversation. 

If you have a question, or I'm unclear, please ask. If I don't have an answer I will try to find one for you. 

### Question: Why is "data management" a thing?

- Personal efficiency
	- If you aren't already, you'll soon be busy. Or you'll just want to spend *some* of your time not working.
	- Thinking about data management stategies early will help you be more effective throughout your PhD and reduce the amount of work at the end.

- Happy advisors
	- Understanding these concepts will make your advisors happy, they'll be able to easily see what you're doing and spend less time teaching you.

- The future
	- The time will come when you've entirely forgotten what you did that one week in the 2nd year of your PhD and don't want someone to emailing you to ask about it 5 years later.
	- Good practices will benefit you and the community. 
	- Depending on how you share your data it will be reusable, by you, your advisor, your lab, and/or the research community in the future. 
	- And! You will get credit for your work.

## Exercise: Understanding interests 
- Which of these topic titles interests you most? What do you expect it will cover and how will this help you?
- What, if anything, do you hope to gain from the workshop series?
