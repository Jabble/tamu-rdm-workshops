# Introducing Research Data Management
## Introductions
1. Your name
2. What you study, your degree or department/discipline
3. Do already have, or work with, data?
4. Why did you sign up for this workshop series?

## Objectives
- Understand the purpose of Research Data Management training.
- Understand the the scope of the workshop series.

## The management perspective
Why is "data management" a thing?

- Personal efficiency
	- If you aren't already, you'll soon be busy. Or you'll just want to spend *some* of your time not working.
	- Thinking about data management stategies will help you be more effective throughout your PhD and reduce the amount of work at the end.

- Happy advisors
	- Understanding these concepts will make your advisors happy, they'll be able to easily see what you're doing and spend less time teaching you.

- The future
	- Good practices will benefit you and the community. 
	- Depending on how you share your data it will be reusable, by you, your advisor, your lab, and/or the research community in the future. 
	- You can get credit for your work and...
	- The time will come when you've entirely forgotten what you did that one week in the 2nd year of your PhD and don't want someone to emailing you to ask about it 5 years later.

## This workshop series
This workshop series is an introduction to research data management topics. The series is broad rather than deep. Some topics may be more relevant to your subject area than others. 

We will spend [#] hours each week on defining concepts, reviewing the effects of different data practices, understanding recommended practices, and using some tools to act on recommendations.

### Our agreement 
If you are a data management expert, this isn't for you. This is a general introduction, some topics may already be intimately familiar to you, or they may not directly apply to your research area. 

We have a diverse group of participants with different experiences and who are dealing with different subject matter. There is one rule:

**Individuals who behave in a manner that shows indent to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort to others will be asked to leave.**

There is no grade. This is a chance for you to gain familiarity, practice, and ask questions. You should be aware that this workshop series includes exercises and hands-on activities. Participation is the point.

If you prefer not to participate, this is fine. I ask that you please give up your seat to someone on the wait list. There is a lot of great material online that covers data management. I'm happy to send you all the resources for this series where you can watch online modules and read on your own.

If you have a question, or I'm unclear, please ask. If I don't have an answer I will try to find one for you.
