# Data Management Plans
## 3. Introduction
Focusing on planning for effective data management in advance of research projects.

The more experience you have, the easier this will become.

The goal now is:

An overview  of the information to be include in a plan. 

- Some elements may be your responsiblity now, 
- Others you may be responsible for later in your research career.

### Discussion
1. Have you heard of a Data Management Plan?
2. What do you think goes into a plan?

If your project is grant funded, you may already be required to follow a Data Management Plan. 
()
- In last week's discussion we mentioned federal funding requirements for more open data.
- DMPs are part of this requirement.

3. Do you know whether you advisor has a Data Management Plan?

## 4. Review
- First workshop we talked about the data lifecycle and diagrams to represent it.
- This is the DataOne data lifecycle diagram again.

We've talked about most of these stages:

2. Collect and document data
- Collect, Describe
3. Store digital data
- Relevant to most areas while you're working on a project and responsible for maintianing data
4. Work with data
- Focused on RDM activities in stages of: Assure, Describe, Integrate, and Analysis
5. Share and preserve data
- Mainly discussed describe formally (metadata record) when sharing and preserving in a data repository.
- Usually upon completion of a project, or to support publication of an article.
6. Plan ahead
- First stage, but the last we'll talk about.
- Brings all the other components together.

## 5. Data management plans
Data Management Plans (DMPs) describe the expected data management activities for:

- a research group, 
- an individual researcher, 
- or a specific research project. 

They are structured documents created in advance of collecting data, 

They describe practices that will be followed over the course of the data lifecycle.

### The value of a plan
Data Management Plans (DMPs) are tools that:

1. Help you think about the data for your projects in a larger context;
2. Provide a framework for documenting your practices;
3. Are required by many grant agencies that fund research.

## 6. Two approaches
For funders: Document written as part of a specific grant proposal.
 
For researchers: "Living" documents describing overall data management practices.

## 7. For funders
Last week we talked about new federal policies for increasing public access to data. 

As part of this, researchers submitting grant proposals to federal funding agencies are also required to submit DMPs.

For the purpose of research grants, DMPs are limited in scope. 

They describe the practices researchers intend to follow on a particular research project. 

Funder's have their own templates outlining the information they expect in a DMP.

Researchers are asked to describe in approximately two pages of text:

- Expected data collected, file formats and sizes.
- And how they intend to ensure that data are:
	- well-maintained (quality assurance, storage, backup, versioning), 
	- shared (access), 
	- and reusable in the future (documented, preserved).

## 8. For researchers
Researchers can also use DMPs as living documents that describe their overall data management practices.

These can also be shared and are refined over time.

As a tool, data management plans allow researchers to:

- Identify relevant practices that improve research efficacy.
- Plan in advance to reduce later costs in time and effort.
- Easily share an overview with collaborators and stakeholders.
- Make incremental changes to meet new needs.
- Speed up the grant application process over multiple cycles.
 
## 9. The audience
1. Often, DMPs are written for specific grant providers. 

In this case, writing a DMP is a matter of answering the right questions for the grant.

- Particular decisions may be more or less important to a research area or project, 
- and a given grant provider may care more or less about certain data management areas.

2. Developing a Data Management Plan is a useful practice for yourself. 

Working on a DMP forces you to think through choices that will affect you, and others, in the future. 

If you write a DMP with the data lifecycle and your future self in mind, you'll respond to what a funder cares about and more. 

DMPs serve to:

- Aid thinking through how you will treat the data in your project.
- And show others (funders) that you've thought about it.
 
Data Management Plans are also living documents that change as you work with data over time. 

Adjusted to the realities of your project, a Data Management Plan is also valuable documentation.

- You can refer to the plan when writing your thesis, dissertation, or a paper.

Once you've written a DMP and implemented it, you will often:

- Be able to write one with more ease in the future.
- Revise and reuse portions for other projects. 

## 10. What's in a plan?
Before experiencing inefficiencies and failures in data management, it's hard to know: 

- what you should pay attention to,
- and how to manage your data.

Luckily, we've covered many recommended practices, tips, and tools that can guide you.
The topics we've discussed highlight which practices are important to consider and get right as you work with data.

Including:

- Ways to document your data throughout your project, 
- Places to store your data,
- Ways to use naming conventions, version control and back up,
- The importance of quality assurance procedures,
- Considerations for data sharing,
- Using repositories as a tool for data preservation.

Once you start dealing with your data, the effort needed to adjust practices increases. 

- Creating a data management plan in advance, 
- Thinking about the topics we've covered
- can help to guide your decision-making, 
- and to avoid later failures and frustrations.

A Data Management Plan doesn't need to be long, 

but it needs to cover the relevant information. 

So, what is relevant?

### Data description
Who is the data steward, and responsible for the data.
The types of data collected or created.
Generally how data be collected or created, and processed.

### Standards
File formats used for collection and working with data.
Additional information (documentation/metadata) needed to make data meaningful, and how it will be captured.
The metadata standards to be followed.

### Policies for access, sharing and re-use
How data will be stored, backed up, and maintained during the project?
How access and security will be controlled.
Note ethical, privacy, or legal issues.
Which data will be shared with others.
How the data will be made available to others, including any restrictions on use.

### Long-term storage and management
Which data will be preserved for the long-term.
The file formats that will be used for long-term accessibility.
Where the data files will be archived and and maintained to ensure preservation.

## 11. Read a DMP
*Hand out example DMP packet*

Take a few minutes to read over the DMPs in the packet and find one you'd like to critique in the next exercise.

Before we move on I'd like to get an idea of you impressions of these plans 

- What strikes you about any of the DMPs in the packet?
- They're in all different disciplines. How do they compare to one another?

## 12. Questions to answer in a DMP

A comprehensive Data Management Plan describes expected data management actions throughout the data lifecycle. 
A narrative description of practices can be guided by answering important questions. 

The answers will be based on your decision to:

- follow good practices,
- meet community expectations,
- and anticipate potential issues.

*Hand out DCC checklist*
### Data Management Plan questions
- What data will you collect and create and how?
	- The nature, scope, and scale of the data that will be generated or collected.
- What types of documentation and metadata will you produce to support the data? 
- How will ethical and legal issues be handled?
	- Who will hold intellectual property rights for the data and other information created by the project?
- How and where will you store data files?
	- Indicate how the data files will be managed during the project, 
		- with information about version control, naming conventions, etc.
	 - Measures to ensure their safety and security,
	 	- including back up and access permissions
- Which data will be retained and shared?
	- Specify how you will ensure that the data meet quality assurance standards.
	- Indicate how data will be selected for archiving, how long the data will be held, and what your plans are for eventual transition or termination.
	- Specify the anticipated submission, distribution, and preservation formats for the data and related files.
- Indicate how you intend to archive and share your data and why you have chosen that particular option.
	- Describe the audience for the data you will produce.
	- Indicate whether any legal requirements or restrictions apply will apply.
- Who will act as the responsible steward for the data throughout the data life cycle?
- What resources, including monetary, will be required?

## 13. Review a DMP
- Which of the above questions does your example answer? 
- Which are omitted?
- Would any omitted information be useful to know?
- Which of these questions are you able to answer for your current research project?

## 14. DMPTool 
The DMPTool is a tool that will walk you through writing a plan. When applying for a grant, it will ask you to answer the questions that different funders care about.
