# Data storage
## Objectives
- Use/Design a file naming convention

## Introduction
- avoiding data loss and security incidents
- Keep organized 
	- Easier to find files
	- Focus on your working with your data

## Areas
- storage: directory structure and file naming conventions
- backup
- security


## File naming conventions
### Useful information
BE CONSISTENT
Have conventions for naming:
(1) Directory structure
(2) Folder names
(3) File names
Always include the same information 
(e.g. date and time)
Retain the order of information
(e.g. YYYYMMDD, not MMDDYYY )

BE DESCRIPTIVE
Try to keep file and folder names under 32 characters
Within reason, Include relevant information such as:

Unique identifier (ie. Project Name or Grant # in folder name)
Project or research data name
Conditions (Lab instrument, Solvent, Temperature, etc.)
Run of experiment (sequential)
Date (in file properties too)
When using sequential numbering, make sure to use leading zeros to allow for multi-digit versions. For example, a sequence of 1-10 should be numbered 01-10; a sequence of 1-100 should be numbered 001-010-100.
No special characters: & , * % # ; * ( ) ! @$ ^ ~ ' { } [ ] ? < > - + /
Use only one period and before the file extension 
(e.g. name_paper.doc NOT name.paper.doc OR name_paper..doc)

### Strategies
Order by date
Order by type
Order by subject
Forced order by number

## Exercise
generate potential file names for your data & document your strategy 
share your strategy with a partner & hear what they came up with
volunteer to share your idea with the class

## Directory structure 


## Storage
## Spreadsheets
- pros/cons from the data management perspective
- Easy to share and to lose track

## Databases
- Easy to share and maintain consistent
- needs a manager

## Cloud servers

Plain text formats are your friend
Naming files sensible things is good for you and for your computers. Without structured information, our lives would be much poorer. **Examples**
