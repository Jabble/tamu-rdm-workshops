# Introducing research data management
Last revised: 2017-11-20
Revised by: Anna Dabrowski

Learning objectives:

- Participants understand the the scope and expectations of the workshop series.

## Your instructor
Let's get to know each other first. I'll introduce myself to you, and then we'll go around and you can talk a little about yourself.

My name is Anna Dabrowski. I'm the Data Management Librarian at the Texas A&M University Libraries. 

A large part of my job is helping researchers with thinking through managing their data, and providing them with information and resources. 
I do this in consulations and workshops like this series.

Your subject librarians are also an excellent resource for you. 
They are familiar with particular disciplines and can often speak more directly to specific needs you may have while conducting your research.

##  Introductions
*Ask participants to introduce themselves in turn.*

1. Your name
2. What do you study – or intend to study – in your research?
3. Do already have – or work with – data?
4. Why did you sign up for this workshop series?
5. Anything else?

## Our schedule
*Fill in schedule*

## Workshop scope
Please keep in mind that we have a diverse group of participants, who are dealing with different subject matter.

- This is a general introduction, with no prerequisites. 
- The series is broad rather than deep. 
- The material we cover is aimed at PhD students working on research proposals, or beginning to conduct research projects.
- Some topics are likely to be more familiar to you than others. 
- We will most likely cover topics that aren't directly applicable to your specific research area. 

This said, I'm eager to get your feedback and direct the material based on your interest. 
I would like you all to feel welcome to share your experience, and to express your thoughts, comments, and questions.

## Our agreement
By participating in this workshop series, you're agreeing to one rule and one expectation.

The only rule that we'll have is:

**Individuals who behave in a manner that shows indent to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort to others will be asked to leave.**

Otherwise, this is a chance for you to gain familiarity, ask questions, and be silly (if you want). 
You should be aware that exercises and hands-on activities are key elements of the workshops, and active participation is expected.

If you prefer not to participate, that is fine. But, this series isn't for you. 

There is a lot of great material available online. 
I'm happy to send you resources where you can watch online modules and read on your own. 
If you're choosing to sit here, you're joining an in-person group conversation. 

If you have a question, or I'm unclear, please ask. If I don't have an answer I will try to find one for you. 

## Discussion
*Ask participants for their definitions of data*

How would you define research data? What are data to you?

<!-- Data are heterogeneous and contextualized within research communities. -->

## Discussion [continued]
There are many definitions for data, often depending on the subjects studied and methods used. 

Even federal grant agencies have different definitions for data:

- NIH: define research data as “Recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to document and support research findings” (National Institutes of Health).
- NSF: describes data as something “determined by the community of interest through the process of peer review and program management” (National Science Foundation). 
	- Examples of data provided by NSF include data, publications, samples, physical collections, software, and models.
- NEH: defines data as “materials generated or collected during the course of conducting research” and provides a wider variety of examples of data than NIH or NSF (National Endowment for the Humanities).

It sounds like the grant agencies would prefer to leave the particulars to the research community,
and nearly anything that is used as evidence to support an argument may be considered "data."

## Defining data
For this workshop series we'll work with the following definition: 

**Research data are information artifacts that scholars draw upon for evidence in supporting research claims, and producing new knowledge.**

We can talk about data very broadly within this definition. 
What data are to you, will largely depend on your discipline, the sorts of things you study and the manner in which you study them.

Research data may include physical artifacts, such as:

- biological specimen, 
- architectural blue prints, 
- paper maps,
- paper surveys

Our focus will be primarily on managing digital data.

## Research Data Management
With that definition in mind, this workshop series will cover topics in managing data.

Research data management (RDM) refers to:

**The practices of organizing, documenting, storing, sharing, and preserving data collected during a research project.**

The aim of research data management is to ensure that data are usable over time.

This idea of usability over time, and across platforms, will keep coming up in this workshop series and drives a lot of the recommended practices we'll discuss.

Ensuring usability over time involves good practices in the everyday handling and workflow of research data during the active phase of a project.
It also includes the practices that support long-term preservation, access, and use after the project has been completed. 

<!-- Data Management, as defined by NOAA's Administrative Order 212-15, "consists of two major activities conducted in coordination: data management services and data stewardship. They constitute a comprehensive end-to-end process including movement of data and information from the observing system sensors to the data user. This process includes the acquisition, quality control, metadata cataloging, validation, reprocessing, storage, retrieval, dissemination, and archival of data.” -->


## Discussion
*Ask participants to explain why they think research data management may be worthwhile.*
Based on this definition of research data management, I’d like to hear from you why do you think research data "management" is a thing to do?  

- What could be the benefits of organizing, documenting, storing, sharing, and preserving data?
- Why does it warrant a whole workshop series? 
- It’s okay to say “my advisor seemed to think it’s important...”

## Discussion [continued]
My selling points are:

1. Personal efficiency.
- If you aren't already, you'll soon be busy. Or you'll just want to spend some of your time not working.
- Thinking about data management stategies early will help you be more effective throughout your PhD and reduce the amount of work at the end.

2. Happy advisors.
- Understanding these concepts will make your advisors happy, they'll be able to easily see what you're doing and spend less time teaching you.

3. The future.
- The time will come when you've entirely forgotten what you did that one week in the 2nd year of your PhD and don't want someone to emailing you to ask about it 5 years later.
- Good practices will benefit you and the community. 
- Depending on how you share your data it will be reusable, by you, your advisor, your lab, and/or the research community in the future. 
- And! You will get credit for your work.

## Topics covered
This workshop series will cover many topics in research data management related to organizing, documenting, storing, sharing, and preserving data, including:

- Collecting and formatting data for easy analysis.
- File organization and naming conventions for identification.
- Documentation and version control for tracking changes and roll-back.
- Managing storage and access locations for security and collaboration.
- Back-up procedures for redundancy.
- Quality control for integrity.
- Policies for sharing and reuse.
- Archiving for future accessibility.

## Discussion
*Ask participants what they're most interested in, return to topic list if needed.*

What do you hope to gain from the workshop series?

- Which of these topic titles interests you most? 
- What do you expect it will cover and how will this help you?

## Conclusion
So far, we’ve covered:

- the scope of this workshop, 
- and talked about definitions for data and research data management.
