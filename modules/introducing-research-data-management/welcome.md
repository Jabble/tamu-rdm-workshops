# Introducing Research Data Management
## Welcome
Objectives:

- Understand the purpose of Research Data Management training.
- Understand the the scope of the workshop series.

## Your instructor
Let's get to know each other first. I'll introduce myself to you, and then we'll go around and you can talk a little about yourself.

My name is Anna Dabrowski. I'm the Data Management Librarian at the Texas A&M University Libraries. 

A large part of my job is helping researchers with thinking through managing their data, and providing them with information and resources. 
I do this in consulations and workshops like this series.

Your subject librarians are also an excellent resource for you. 
They are familiar with particular disciplines and can often speak more directly to specific needs you may have while conducting your research.

##  Introductions
<!-- Ask participants to introduce themselves in turn -->

1. Your name
2. What do you study or intend to study in your research?
3. Do already have, or work with, data?
4. Why did you sign up for this workshop series?
5. Anything else?

## Our schedule


## Our agreement 
Please keep in mind that we have a diverse group of participants, who are dealing with different subject matter.

By participating in this workshop series, we have an agreement. 

This is a general introduction, with no prerequisites. The series is broad rather than deep. 
The material we cover is aimed at PhD students working on their proposals, or just beginning to conduct their research projects.


Some topics are likely to be more familiar to you than others, and we may also cover topics that aren't directly applicable to your specific research area. 

This said, I'm eager to get your feedback and direct the material based on your interest. I would like you all to feel welcome to share your experience, and to express your thoughts, comments, and questions.

Along these lines, there is one rule:

**Individuals who behave in a manner that shows indent to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort to others will be asked to leave.**

There is no grade. This is a chance for you to gain familiarity, practice, ask questions, and be silly (if you want). You should be aware that exercises and hands-on activities are key elements of the workshops, and active participation is expected.

If you prefer not to participate, this is fine. But, I ask that you please give up your seat to someone on the wait list. There is a lot of great material available online that covers data management. I'm happy to send you all the resources for this series where you can watch online modules and read on your own. If you're choosing to sit here, then you're choosing to join in a group conversation. 

If you have a question, or I'm unclear, please ask. If I don't have an answer I will try to find one for you. 


## Research Data Management
Research Data Management (RDM) refers to the practices of organizing, documenting, storing, sharing, and preserving data collected during a research project. 

The aim of research data management is to ensure that data are usable over time.

The idea of usability over time, and across platforms, will keep coming up in this workshop series and drives a lot of the recommended practices we will discuss.

The National Institutes of Health define research data as “Recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to document and support research findings” (National Institutes of Health).
The National Science Foundation’s definition describes data as something “determined by the community of interest through the process of peer review and program management” (National Science Foundation). Examples of data provided by NSF include data, publications, samples, physical collections, software, and models.
The National Endowment for the Humanities defines data as “materials generated or collected during the course of conducting research” and provides a wider variety of examples of data than NIH or NSF (National Endowment for the Humanities).

Data should be valid, shared, and are heterogeneous and contextualized within research communities.

Data management refers to the everyday handling and workflow of research data during the active phase of a project as well as the practices that support long-term preservation, access, and use after the project has been completed. These activities can include planning, documenting data, formatting data, storing data, anonymizing data, and controlling access to data.

Data Management, as defined by NOAA's Administrative Order 212-15, "consists of two major activities conducted in coordination: data management services and data stewardship. They constitute a comprehensive end-to-end process including movement of data and information from the observing system sensors to the data user. This process includes the acquisition, quality control, metadata cataloging, validation, reprocessing, storage, retrieval, dissemination, and archival of data.”

### Data
Research data are information artifacts that scholars draw upon for evidence in supporting research claims, and producing new knowledge.

We can define data very broadly. Research data could include any number of physical artifacts, such as a biological specimen, an architectural blue print, a paper map, etc.

Our focus will be on digital data.

### Question: Why is "data management" a thing?

- Personal efficiency
	- If you aren't already, you'll soon be busy. Or you'll just want to spend *some* of your time not working.
	- Thinking about data management stategies early will help you be more effective throughout your PhD and reduce the amount of work at the end.

- Happy advisors
	- Understanding these concepts will make your advisors happy, they'll be able to easily see what you're doing and spend less time teaching you.

- The future
	- The time will come when you've entirely forgotten what you did that one week in the 2nd year of your PhD and don't want someone to emailing you to ask about it 5 years later.
	- Good practices will benefit you and the community. 
	- Depending on how you share your data it will be reusable, by you, your advisor, your lab, and/or the research community in the future. 
	- And! You will get credit for your work.

## Exercise: Understanding interests 
- Which of these topic titles interests you most? What do you expect it will cover and how will this help you?
- What, if anything, do you hope to gain from the workshop series?
