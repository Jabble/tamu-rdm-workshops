# Data Management Plans
## 2. 
- This is our final workshop.
- We'll talk primarily about writing plans for managing your research data.
- Then review a useful tool that can also support collaborative work.

## 3. Introduction
- Focus on planning for effective data management in advance of research projects.
- The more experience you have, the easier this will become.
- The goal it to have an overview of information to be include in a plan.
	- Some of which may be your responsiblity to implement now, 
	- and some of which you may be responsible for later in your research career.

### Discussion
- Have you heard of a Data Management Plan?
	- What do you think goes into a plan?
- If your project is grant funded, you may already be required to follow a Data Management Plan. 
- Do you know whether you advisor has a Data Management Plan?

## 4. Review
- First workshop we reviewed the idea of a data lifecycle and diagrams to explain it.
- This is the DataOne data lifecycle diagram again.

We've talked about most of these stages:

2. Collect and document data
- Collect, Describe
3. Store digital data
- Relevant to most areas while you're working on a project and responsible for maintianing data
4. Work with data
- Focused on RDM activities in stages of: Assure, Describe, Integrate, and Analysis
5. Share and preserve data
- Mainly discussed describe formally (metadata record) when sharing and preserving in a data repository.
- Usually upon completion of a project, or to support publication of an article.
6. Plan ahead
- First stage, but the last we'll talk about.
- Brings all the other compnenets together.

## 5. Data management plans
Data Management Plans (DMPs) describe the expected data management activities for:

- a research group, 
- researcher, 
- or research project. 

They are structured documents created in advance of collecting data, 
and describe practices that will be followed over the course of the data lifecycle.

### The value of a plan
Data Management Plans (DMPs) are tools that:

- Help you think about the data for your projects in a larger context;
- provide a framework for documenting your practices;
- are a requirement for many grants that fund research.

## 6. Two approaches
For funders: Document written as part of a grant proposal.
 
For researchers: Living documents describing overall data management practices.

## 7. For funders
For the purpose of research grants, DMPs are limited in scope. 

They describe the practices researchers intend to follow on a particular research project. 

Funder's have their own templates outlining the information they expect in a DMP
Researchers are asked to outline in approximately two pages of text:

- Expected data collected , file formats and sizes.
- And how they intend to ensure that data are:
	- well-maintained (quality assurance, storage, backup, versioning), 
	- shared (access), 
	- and reusable in the future (documented, preserved).

## 8. For researchers
Researchers can also use DMPs as living documents that describe their overall data management practices.

These can also be shared and are refined over time.

As a tool, data management plans allow researchers to:

- Identify relevant practices that improve research efficacy.
- Plan in advance to reduce later costs in time and effort.
- Easily share an overview with collaborators and stakeholders.
- Make incremental changes to meet the needs of their research community.
- Speed up the grant application process over multiple cycles.
 
## 9. The audience
- Often, DMPs are written for specific grant providers. 
- In this case, writing a DMP is a matter of answering the right questions for the grant. 
	- Particular decisions may be more or less important to a research area or project, 
	- and a given grant provider may care more or less about certain data management areas.

However, one point I'd like to make is that:

Developing a Data Management Plan is a useful practice for yourself. 

- Working on a DMP forces you to think through choices that will affect you, and others, in the future. 
- If you write a DMP with the data lifecycle and your future self in mind, you'll also respond to what a funder cares about and more. 

At first DMPs serve to:

- Aid thinking through how you will treat the data in your project.
- And show others (funders) that you've thought about it.
 
Data Management Plans are also living documents that change as you work with data over time. 
Adjusted to the realities of your project, a Data Management Plan is also valuable documentation.

- You can refer to the plan when writing your thesis, dissertation, or a paper.

Once you've written a DMP and implemented it, you will often:

- Be able to answer the questions with more ease in the future.
- And even reuse portions for other projects. 

## 10. What's in a plan?
Before experiencing inefficiencies and failures in data management, it's hard to know 
- what you should pay attention to,
- and how to manage your data 

We've covered some recommended practices, tips, and tools 
these can guide you to which practices are worthwhile
**including...documentation, etc. etc.**

Once you start dealing with your data, the effort needed to adjust practices increases. 
Creating a Data Management Plan in advance based on the topics we've covered
can help to guide your decision-making, 
so that you can start with good practices in mind and avoid failures and frustrations.

- A Data Management Plan doesn't need to be long, 
- but it needs to cover the relevant information. 
- So, what is relevant?

### Data description
Who will be responsible for the data and their management?
What types of data will be collected or created?
How will data be collected or created, and processed?

### Standards
Which file formats will be used for working data?
What additional information is needed to make data meaningful, how will this be captured?
What forms will additional descriptive material take?
Which metadata standards will be followed?

### Policies for access, sharing and re-use
How will data be stored, backed up, and maintained during the project?
How will you manage access and security?
Are there any ethical, privacy, or legal issues?
How will the data be shared or made available? Are there any restrictions?
What are intended or anticipated future uses?

### Long-term storage and management
Which data will be preserved for the long-term?
Which file formats will be used for long-term accessibility?
Where will data be archived and how will they be maintained to ensure preservation?

## 11. Read a DMP
*Find examples in multiple disciplines to make available*

Identify an interesting Data Management Plan in the example plans and take a few minutes to read through it. If you find one related to your discipline all the better.

- What strikes you about the plan you read?


## 12. Questions to answer in a DMP
A comprehensive Data Management Plan describes expected data management actions throughout the data lifecycle. 
A narrative description of practices can be guided by answering important questions. 

The answers will be based on your decision to

- follow good practices,
- meet community expectations,
- and anticipate potential issues.

**Data Management Plan questions**

From: http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/datamanagement/dmp/framework.html

- Provide a brief description of the information to be gathered -- the nature, scope, and scale of the data that will be generated or collected.
- Are there existing data with a focus similar to the data that will be produced? If so, list what they are and explain why it is important to collect new data.
- Who will hold intellectual property rights for the data and other information created by the project?
	- Will these rights be transferred to another organization for data distribution and archiving? Will any copyrighted material (e.g., instruments or scales) be used? If so, how will the project obtain permission to use the materials and disseminate them?
- If applicable, how will you handle informed consent with respect to communicating to respondents that the information they provide will remain confidential when data are shared or made available for secondary analysis?
- Who will act as the responsible steward for the data throughout the data life cycle?
- What types of metadata will you produce to support the data? Will a metadata standard be used?
- How will the costs for creating data and documentation suitable for archiving be paid?
- Indicate how the data will be managed during the project, with information about version control, naming conventions, etc.
- How and where will you store copies of your research files to ensure their safety? How many copies will you maintain and how will you keep them synchronized?
- How will you ensure that the data are secure?
- Specify how you will ensure that the data meet quality assurance standards.
- Indicate how you intend to archive and share your data and why you have chosen that particular option.
	- Describe the audience for the data you will produce.
	- How will you ensure that data are preserved for the long term?
	- Specify the anticipated submission, distribution, and preservation formats for the data and related files (note that these formats may be the same).
	- Indicate how data will be selected for archiving, how long the data will be held, and what your plans are for eventual transition or termination of the data collection in the future.
	- Indicate whether any legal requirements apply to archiving and sharing your data.

## 13. Review a DMP
- Which of the above Data Management Plan Questions does your example Data Management Plan answer? 
- Which are omitted?
- Would any omitted information be useful to know?
- Which of these questions are you able to answer for your current research project?

## Tools and resources 
Many resources are available to help you write a Data Management Plan.

- DataONE([Website](https://www.dataone.org/data-management-planning))
