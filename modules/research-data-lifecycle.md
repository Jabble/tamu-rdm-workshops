# The research data lifecycle
## Objectives
- Recognize that research data has a "lifetime" or "lifecycle."

## Introduction
In this workshop series we will think about managing research data over time. Lifecycle diagrams provide an overview of how data is created and can be used over time. We'll look at two lifecycles that inform this workshop series.

## DataOne lifecycle

The DataONE data life cycle has eight components:

- Plan: description of the data that will be compiled, and how the data will be managed and made accessible throughout its lifetime
- Collect: observations are made either by hand or with sensors or other instruments and the data are placed a into digital form
- Assure: the quality of the data are assured through checks and inspections
- Describe: data are accurately and thoroughly described using the appropriate metadata standards
- Preserve: data are submitted to an appropriate long-term archive (i.e. data center)
- Discover: potentially useful data are located and obtained, along with the relevant information about the data (metadata)
- Integrate: data from disparate sources are combined to form one homogeneous set of data that can be readily analyzed
- Analyze: data are analyzed

## DCC Curation Lifecycle

The lifecycle focuses specifically on curation activities.

## Simplified lifecycle
This workshop series will cover data management practices within components of the data lifecycle.

- Plan
- Collect and manage (incl. Discovery and Integration)
- Assure 
- Analyze and present
- Share and Preserve
