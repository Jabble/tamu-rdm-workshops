# The research data lifecycle
## Objectives
- Recognize that research data has a "lifetime" or "lifecycle."

## Introduction
In this workshop series we will think about managing research data over time. Lifecycle diagrams provide an overview of how data are created and can be used over time. We'll look at two lifecycles that inform this workshop series.

## Exercise: Draw the lifecycle of your data
Let's say step one is finding or gathering your research data. Once you've gathered it, draw out the steps of what you'll do with your data over the course of your project, until you're "done." It's okay to have a few "big steps"

*Students draw the research data lifecycle as they understand it, for their existing or expected research projects*

## DataOne data lifecycle
The DataONE data life cycle has eight components:

- Plan: description of the data that will be compiled, and how the data will be managed and made accessible throughout its lifetime
- Collect: observations are made either by hand or with sensors or other instruments and the data are placed a into digital form
- Assure: the quality of the data are assured through checks and inspections
- Describe: data are accurately and thoroughly described using the appropriate metadata standards
- Preserve: data are submitted to an appropriate long-term archive (i.e. data center)
- Discover: potentially useful data are located and obtained, along with the relevant information about the data (metadata)
- Integrate: data from disparate sources are combined to form one homogeneous set of data that can be readily analyzed
- Analyze: data are analyzed

## DCC data curation lifecycle
The lifecycle focuses specifically on curation activities. 

Conceptualise 
Create or Receive
Appraise and Select 
Ingest
Preservation Action
Store 
Access, Use and Reuse 
Transform


## Simplified lifecycle
This workshop series will cover data management activities within stages of the data lifecycle.

1. Plan management
2. Collect and store 
3. Assure quality
4. Analyze and present
5. Share and preserve

*Make drawing of data lifecycle as covered in the workshop series*

Since we're taking a lifecycle approach, we'll look at how practices at each stage impact later stages in the lifecycle.
