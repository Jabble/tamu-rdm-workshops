# The research data lifecycle
## Objectives
- Recognize that research data has a "lifetime" or "lifecycle."

## Introduction
In this workshop series we will think about managing research data over time. Lifecycle diagrams provide an overview of how data are created and used over time. We'll look at two lifecycles that inform this workshop series.

## Exercise: Draw the lifecycle of your data
Draw out steps in the life of your research data for a past, existing, or anticipated research project.

Let's say step one is gathering your research data. Write out the steps of what you'll do with your data over the course of your project once you've gathered them, until you're "done" with the data. It's okay to have a few big steps.

## DataOne data lifecycle
The DataONE data life cycle has eight components:

- Plan: description of the data that will be compiled, and how the data will be managed and made accessible throughout its lifetime
- Collect: observations are made either by hand or with sensors or other instruments and the data are placed a into digital form
- Assure: the quality of the data are assured through checks and inspections
- Describe: data are accurately and thoroughly described using the appropriate metadata standards
- Preserve: data are submitted to an appropriate long-term archive (i.e. data center)
- Discover: potentially useful data are located and obtained, along with the relevant information about the data (metadata)
- Integrate: data from disparate sources are combined to form one homogeneous set of data that can be readily analyzed
- Analyze: data are analyzed

## DCC data curation lifecycle
The lifecycle focuses specifically on curation activities. 

- Conceptualise 
- Create or Receive
- Appraise and Select 
- Ingest
- Preservation Action
- Store 
- Access, Use and Reuse 
- Transform

## Simplified lifecycle
This workshop series will cover data management activities within stages of the data lifecycle.

1. Introduction to Research Data Management
2. Collect and document data
3. Store digital data
4. Work with data
5. Share and preserve data
6. Plan ahead

Since we're taking a lifecycle approach, we'll look at how practices at each stage impact later stages in the lifecycle. 

### Workshops

1. Introduction to Research Data Management
2. Collect and document data
3. Store digital data
4. Work with data
5. Share and preserve data
6. Plan ahead

This 6-week series provides an overview of research data management concepts. It covers good practices, tools, tips, and resources for effective management of digital data, including:

Data formatting for easy analysis.
File organization and naming conventions for identification.
Quality control for integrity.
Documentation and version control for tracking changes and roll-back.
Managing storage for security.
Back-up procedures for redundancy.
Policies for sharing and reuse.
Archiving and preservation for future accessibility
