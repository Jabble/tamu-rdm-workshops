# The research data lifecycle

## Objectives
Recognize that research data has a "lifetime" or "lifecycle."

## Introduction
In this workshop series we'll think about research data over time. Lifecycle diagrams are a good way to generally model how data is created and used over time. We'll look at two lifecycles that inform this Research Data Management workshop series.

## DataOne lifecycle

The DataONE data life cycle has eight components:

- Plan: description of the data that will be compiled, and how the data will be managed and made accessible throughout its lifetime
- Collect: observations are made either by hand or with sensors or other instruments and the data are placed a into digital form
- Assure: the quality of the data are assured through checks and inspections
- Describe: data are accurately and thoroughly described using the appropriate metadata standards
- Preserve: data are submitted to an appropriate long-term archive (i.e. data center)
- Discover: potentially useful data are located and obtained, along with the relevant information about the data (metadata)
- Integrate: data from disparate sources are combined to form one homogeneous set of data that can be readily analyzed
- Analyze: data are analyzed

## Simplified lifecycle
This workshop series will cover data management practices within components of the data lifecycle.
Plan -> Collect (incl. Discovery and Integration) -> Assure and Analyze -> Share and Preserve
