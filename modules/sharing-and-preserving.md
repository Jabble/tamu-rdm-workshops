## Maintaining your data over time
During your research, you will need to make sure your data are not lost, stolen, or corrupted. But, you will also need to hang on to the data after your project is complete.

### External requirements
Your funder, publisher, and/or institution are likely to have data retention policies. Meaning that you will need to safely store your data for a certain period after your project is complete. 

For Texas A&M University, the minimum research data retention period is **3 years**. 

Standard Administrative Procedure 15.99.03.M1.03 "The Responsible Stewardship of Research Data" [PDF](http://rules-saps.tamu.edu/PDFs/15.99.03.M1.03.pdf)

### Long-term usefulness
Beyond any externally imposed requirments, you should think about the long-term usefulness of your data. 

If the data are from an experiment that you anticipate will be repeatable more quickly, inexpensively, and accurately as technology progresses, you may want to store it for a relatively brief period. 

If the data consists of observations made outside the laboratory that can never be repeated, you may wish to store it indefinitely.


## Sharing and Archiving
Why share your data?

Required by publishers (e.g., Cell, Nature, Science).
Required by government funding agencies (e.g., NIH, NSF)
Allows data to be used to answer new questions
Makes research more open
Makes your papers more useful and citable by other researchers
Considerations when preparing to share data

File Formats for Long Term Access: The file format in which you keep your data is a primary factor in one's ability to use your data in the future. Plan for both hardware and software obsolescence. See file formats and organization for details on long-term storage formats.
Don't Forget the Documentation: Document your research and data so others can interpret the data. Begin to document your data at the very beginning of your research project and continue throughout the project. See data documentation and metadata for details.
Ownership and Privacy: Make sure that you have considered the implications of sharing data in terms of copyright, IP ownership, and subject confidentiality. See copyright and confidentiality for details.
Ways to share your data

Email to individual requesters
Post online via a project or personal web site
Submit as supplemental material to be hosted on a journal publisher's website
Deposit in an open repository or archive
Deposit in an open repository and publish a "data paper" describing the data
While the first three options above are valid ways to share data, a repository is much more able to provide long-term access. Data deposited in a repository can be supplemented with a "data paper"—a relatively new type of publication that describes a dataset, but does not analyze it or draw any conclusions—published in a journal such as Nature Scientific Data or Geoscience Data Journal

Finding a data repository

You should select a repository or archive for your data based on the long-term security offered and the ease of discovery and access by colleagues in your field. There are two common types of repository to look for:

Discipline specific: accepts data in a particluar field or of a particluar type (e.g., GenBank accepts nucleotide sequence data)
Institutional: accepts data of any type produced within the institution that maintains it (e.g., the University of California's Merritt)
A searchable and browsable list of repositories can be found at these websites:

re3data.org: a REgistry of REsearch data REpositories
Data Repositories in the Open Access Directory: a list of repositories hosted by Simmons College
BioSharing: a directory of life sciences databases and reporting standards
Citing Data
Citing data is important in order to:

Give the data producer appropriate credit
Allow easier access to the data for re-purposing or re-use
Enable readers to verify your results
Citation Elements

A dataset should be cited formally in an article's reference list, not just informally in the text. Many data repositories and publishers provide explicit instructions for citing their contents. If no citation information is provided, you can still construct a citation following generally agreed-upon guidelines from sources such as the Force 11 Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles and the current DataCite Metadata Schema.

Core elements

There are 5 core elements usually included in a dataset citation, with additional elements added as appropriate.

Creator(s) – may be individuals or organizations
Title
Publication year when the dataset was released (may be different from the Access date)
Publisher – the data center, archive, or repository
Identifier – a unique public identifier (e.g., an ARK or DOI)
Creator names in non-Roman scripts should be transliterated using the ALA-LC Romanization Tables.

Common additional elements

Although the core elements are sufficient in the simplest case – citation to the entirety of a static dataset – additional elements may be needed if you wish to cite a dynamic dataset or a subset of a larger dataset. 
Version of the dataset analyzed in the citing paper
Access date when the data was accessed for analysis in the citing paper
Subset of the dataset analyzed (e.g., a range of dates or record numbers, a list of variables)
Verifier that the dataset or subset accessed by a reader is identical to the one analyzed by the author (e.g., a Checksum)
Location of the dataset on the internet, needed if the identifier is not "actionable" (convertable to a web address)
