# Legal and ethical considerations
<!-- Last revised: 2018-05-01

Revised by: Anna Dabrowski -->

Learning objectives:

- Participants understand that legal and ethical considerations impact how data are managed.
- Participants are able to identify potential legal or ethical concerns for their research project(s).

## Introduction
In this module, we'll discuss legal and ethical issues that need to be tackled when working with data. 

The goal is to help you identify and understand your obligations.

## Discussion
Before we talk about data ownership:

- Do you know who owns the data you collect and work with?
- Is there a difference between data you create and existing data you use from another source?

## Who owns the data?
This question is important to ask, because the owner will be the individual or entity that has certain legal rights to the data, and is the party (person or group) that can retain the data after the completion of a project.

Data ownership can be very complex, and is specific to a project and situation.

Before starting a project you should have an idea of the ownership issues related to research products resulting from your particular project, including data.

## Stakeholders
Data are seen as assets and therefore research stakeholders want to protect their **intellectual property rights** — legal rights to data.

Different people or groups may be stakeholders claiming ownership or some level of control over research data, including:

- Funders: the groups that provide money to conduct research through grants or contracts, sometimes these will be government bodies, sometimes private or philanthropic organizations.
- Institutions (Texas A&M University): This will be where the researcher works, and who pays their salary.
- Research faculty (Your advisor, a Principle Investigator): The person leading the research project, and often the one writing the grant proposal.
- Data collectors (You): The person working with the principle investigator on a research project

### Determining ownership
Ownership can be determined by:

- Funder agreements (grants or contracts)
- Institutional Intellectual Property policies
- A data use agreement
- A license attached to the data

### Texas A&M University
Institutional policies can help ascertain who owns data produced at an institution and under what circumstances someone may:

- Access data
- Take data
- Share data
- Publish data
 
3. Ownership
"Unless precluded by a Texas A&M University contract agreeing to specific other terms, research data conducted on a Texas A&M University project belongs to Texas A&M University."

Standard Administrative Procedure 15.99.03.M1.03 "The Responsible Stewardship of Research Data" [PDF](http://rules-saps.tamu.edu/PDFs/15.99.03.M1.03.pdf)

## Claiming ownership and control
Rights of control over data, or access to data, can be given without legally changing ownership of the data. 

Although you may not be able to claim ownership over data, you may still have control over, or access to data. 

Think of this a little like using a service such as spotify to listen to music. Spotify has contracts with artists. You have access to music, but you don’t own that music.

### Example: Federally funded research grant
In most cases for federally funded research, the government gives the research institution the right to use data collected with public funds as an incentive to put research to use for the common good. 
Thus the research institution owns the data but allows the principal investigator (PI) on the grant to be the steward of the data.

The PI takes responsibility for the collection, recording, storage, retention and disposal of data. They can claim control over the data. 

Meanwhile the graduate students, postdocs, or faculty involved in performing research on a particular grant cannot assume that they own the data that they are collecting and managing. 

Students should not take the data with them when they leave the institution unless they have made appropriate arrangements with the project PI.

<!-- ## Funders
### Federal grants and contracts
Under grants, researchers must carry out the research and submit reports, but control of the data remains with the institution that received the funds.
With contracts, the researcher is required to deliver a product or service, which is then usually controlled by the government.

### Private funders
Private funders seek to retain the rights for commercial use of the data.

### Philanthropic funders
Depending on their interests, they may retain or give away ownership rights. -->

## Intellectual Property
As we mentioned a little while ago, data are seen as assets and therefore research stakeholders want to protect their **intellectual property rights**.

Now, we’ll talk a little about which Intellectual Property rights can be granted to the owners of data.

Generally Intellectual Property (IP) law covers:

- Copyright
- Patents
- Trademarks
- Industrial Designs

Intellectual property generated in an academic setting usually involves copyrights, trade secrets, and patents.

## Copyright
Copyright is a legal protection for the creators of "original works of authorship."

- Applies to a work immediately upon fixation in a tangible medium of expression.
- Gives the creator exclusive legal right to:
	- Reproduce
	- Prepare derivative works 
	- Distribute copies
	- Perform or display publicly
	- Grant licenses or transfer copyrights to others

"It is illegal for anyone to violate any of the rights provided by the copyright law to the owner of copyright. These rights, however, are not unlimited in scope."

From: "Copyright Basics," U.S. Copyright Office, [PDF](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf)

## The problem with data
Copyright is restricted to work that includes a level of "creative expression." This is where issues arise with data. 

Copyright does **not** apply to: 

- Facts
- The labor of research

The distinction between pure fact and "creative expression" is determined primarily by current case law. For this reason, copyright can be difficult to determine for data and datasets. 

In some cases, the arrangement or compilation of data or portions of a dataset may be protected by copyright. However, definitions of data and types of data vary and it's best to play it safe. 

## Licenses and credit for data
How to play it safe? 

When reusing data:

- follow the instructions of the data creators
- follow community norms and cite the original creators

When sharing data:

- make clear to others how others can use your data and how to cite you



## Restricted data
Some data may need to be kept secure due to agreements, rules, and regulations. These will dictate how you are able to interact with the data.

You may encounter data pertaining to or including:

- National security and classified information
- Controlled unclassified information
- Threatened and endangered species information
- Indigenous peoples and lands information
- Human subjects research (IRB)
- Personal health information (HIPAA)
- Student education records (FERPA)

## Privacy and confidentiality
Privacy relates to the rights of an individual or subject. 

Confidentiality relates to the actions of the researcher.

### Ethics

- IRB and Ethical review
- Safeguarding data and data destruction



"Confidentiality refers to the researcher’s agreement with the participant about how the participant’s identifiable private information will be handled, managed, and disseminated. The research proposal should outline strategies to maintain confidentiality of identifiable data, including controls on storage, handling, and sharing of personal data.

You can minimise the risk of disclosing confidential information when designing your research by considering the following factors and approaches:

If possible, collect the necessary data without using personally identifying information.

If personally identifying information is required, de-identify your data upon collection or as soon as possible thereafter.

Avoid transmitting unencrypted personal data electronically.

Other considerations include retention of original collection instruments, such as paper questionnaires or interview recordings. Once these are transferred into an analysis package or a transcript and quality assured or validated, there may no longer be a reason to retain them. 

Questions of which data to keep and for how long need to be considered in the context of your ability to maintain the confidentiality of your subjects’ information, and should be planned in advance."
