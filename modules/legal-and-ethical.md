# Legal and ethical considerations
## Objectives
- Understand that legal and ethical considerations impact how data are managed.
- Identify potential legal or ethical concerns with your research project(s).

## Introduction
In this module, we'll discuss legal and ethical issues that need to be tackled when working with data. The goal is to help you identify and understand your obligations.  

## Intellectual Property
Intellectual Property (IP) refers to:

- Copyright
- Patents
- Trademarks
- Industrial Designs

## Copyright
Copyright is a legal protection for the creators of "original works of authorship."

- Applies to a work immediately upon fixation in a tangible medium of expression.
- Gives the creator exclusive legal right to:
	- Reproduce
	- Prepare derivative works 
	- Distribute copies
	- Perform or display publicly
	- Grant licenses or transfer copyrights to others

"It is illegal for anyone to violate any of the rights provided by the copyright law to the owner of copyright. These rights, however, are not unlimited in scope."

From: "Copyright Basics," U.S. Copyright Office, [PDF](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf)

## The problem with data
Copyright is restricted to work that includes a level of "creative expression." This is where issues arise with data. 

Copyright does **not** apply to: 

- Facts
- The labor of research

The distinction between pure fact and "creative expression" is determined primarily by current case law. For this reason, copyright can be difficult to determine for data and datasets. 

In some cases, the arrangement of data or portions of a dataset may be protected. Since definitions of data and types of data vary, it's best to play it safe. 

## Licenses and credit for data
How to play it safe? 

When reusing data:

- follow the instructions of other data creators
- follow community norms and cite the original

When creating data:

- Make it clear to others how they can use your data and how to cite you.

## The difference between ownership and control
Although you may not be able to legally claim copyright over particular arrangements or types of data, you may still have some control over the data.

From: "Legal and Policy Issues", DataOne

A data set, produced under a federal grant, contained within an institutional data repository may be owned by that institution. The Principle Investigator of the project that generated that data, while not the owner, maybe grants the authority to restrict or release access to that data, or limit the use of the data by others.  In this circumstance, the PI can claim **control** of the data without the ability to claim **ownership**. 

## Data ownership
Rights of control over data or access to data can be given without shifting ownership.

Different people or groups can claim control or ownership over research data. It may be:

- You
- Your advisor
- Texas A&M University
- A funder 

Ownership can be determined in:

- Funder agreements
- Institutional Intellectual Property policy
- A data use agreement
- A license attached to the data

### Texas A&M University 
From: Standard Administrative Procedure 15.99.03.M1.03 "The Responsible Stewardship of Research Data" [PDF](http://rules-saps.tamu.edu/PDFs/15.99.03.M1.03.pdf)

3. Ownership
"Unless precluded by a Texas A&M University contract agreeing to specific other terms, research data conducted on a Texas A&M University project belongs to Texas A&M University."



University Rule 29.01.03.M1

## Restricted data
Some data may need to be kept secure due to agreements, rules, and regulations. These will dictate how you are able to interact with the data.

You may encounter data pertaining to or including:

- National security and classified information
- Controlled unclassified information
- Threatened and endangered species information
- Indigenous peoples and lands information
- Human subjects research (IRB)
- Personal Health information (HIPAA)

## Privacy and confidentiality
Privacy relates to the individual or subject. Confidentiality relates to the actions of the researcher.

## Ethics
- IRB and Ethical review
- Safeguarding data and data destruction

From: MANTRA Research Data Management Training [website](http://datalib.edina.ac.uk/mantra/)

"Confidentiality refers to the researcher’s agreement with the participant about how the participant’s identifiable private information will be handled, managed, and disseminated. The research proposal should outline strategies to maintain confidentiality of identifiable data, including controls on storage, handling, and sharing of personal data.

You can minimise the risk of disclosing confidential information when designing your research by considering the following factors and approaches:

If possible, collect the necessary data without using personally identifying information.

If personally identifying information is required, de-identify your data upon collection or as soon as possible thereafter.

Avoid transmitting unencrypted personal data electronically.

Other considerations include retention of original collection instruments, such as paper questionnaires or interview recordings. Once these are transferred into an analysis package or a transcript and quality assured or validated, there may no longer be a reason to retain them. 

Questions of which data to keep and for how long need to be considered in the context of your ability to maintain the confidentiality of your subjects’ information, and should be planned in advance."
