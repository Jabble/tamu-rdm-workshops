# Legal and ethical considerations
## Objectives
- Understand that legal and ethical considerations impact data management
- Identify potential legal or ethical concerns with your research project(s)

## Introduction


## Privacy and confidentiality
Privacy relates to the individual or subject. Confidentiality relates to the actions of the researcher.

## Ethics
- IRB and Ethical review
- Safeguarding data and data destruction

From: MANTRA Research Data Management Training [website](http://datalib.edina.ac.uk/mantra/)

"Confidentiality refers to the researcher’s agreement with the participant about how the participant’s identifiable private information will be handled, managed, and disseminated. The research proposal should outline strategies to maintain confidentiality of identifiable data, including controls on storage, handling, and sharing of personal data.

You can minimise the risk of disclosing confidential information when designing your research by considering the following factors and approaches:

If possible, collect the necessary data without using personally identifying information.

If personally identifying information is required, de-identify your data upon collection or as soon as possible thereafter.

Avoid transmitting unencrypted personal data electronically.

Other considerations include retention of original collection instruments, such as paper questionnaires or interview recordings. Once these are transferred into an analysis package or a transcript and quality assured or validated, there may no longer be a reason to retain them. 

Questions of which data to keep and for how long need to be considered in the context of your ability to maintain the confidentiality of your subjects’ information, and should be planned in advance."


## Restricted data
In addition to ethical concerns, some data may need to be kept secure due to agreements, rules, and regulations. These will dictate how you are able to interact with the data.

You may encounter:

- National security and classified information
- Controlled unclassified information
- Threatened and endangered species information
- Human subject information

 
## Data ownership
Control over data does not mean ownership. Rights of control over data or access to data can be given without shifting ownership.

Different people or groups can claim control or ownership over research data. It may be:

- You
- Your advisor
- Texas A&M University
- A funder 

Ownership can be determined in:

- Funder agreement
- Institutional Intellectual Property policy
- A data use agreement
- A license attached to the data
