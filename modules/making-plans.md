# Making plans
## Objectives
- Understand the value of Data Management Plans as working documents.
- Identify relevant questions to ask about data in research projects.

## Survey
- Have you heard of a Data Management Plan?
- You may already be required to follow a DMP. If your project is grant funded, do you know whether you advisor has a Data Management Plan?

## Introduction
In order to plan in advance of (or during) your research projects, you'll need to understand why the practices outlined in a Data Management Plan are relevant. We reviewed the data lifecycle (research-data-lifecycle.md) to give you an overview. Although you may not be responsible for the whole lifecycle, it helps to understand how your work fits into the concerns of your advisor, your collaborators, your lab or center, the university, and funding agencies.

This module will give you an overview of what can be included in a plan. The rest of this series will focus on why each area covered by a Data Management Plan is relevant to the data lifecycle, and how you can establish good practices in those areas. A good Data Management Plan will describe how you implement the data management practices we cover. If you follow this series, you'll be able to make a plan for your data... and do even more.

## The value of a plan
Data Management Plans (DMPs) are tools that:

- Help you think about the data for your projects in a larger context.
	- It's hard to know what you should pay attention to and how to do so before having the experience of inefficiencies and failures in data management.
	- Once you start dealing with your data, the effort to adjust practices rapidly increases.
	- DMPs can help to guide you in what is relevant to consider during your project so that you can avoid failures and frustrations, and start with good practices in mind.
- Provide a framework for documenting your practices.
	- Initially DMPS serve to aid thinking through how you will treat the data in your project. 
	- DMPs are living documents and change as you work with the data over time and adjust your practices. Adjusted to the realities of your project, DMPs serve as valuable documentation. You refer to them when writing your thesis, dissertation, article, and as a future reference document. 
- Are a requirement for many grants that fund research.
	- Once you've written a DMP and implemented it, you will often be able to answer the questions with more ease in the future and even reuse portions for other projects. 
 
##  What's in a plan?
- It's hard to know what you should pay attention to and how to manage your data before having the experience of inefficiencies and failures in data management.
- Once you start dealing with your data, the effort needed to adjust practices increases.
- Creating a Data Management Plan can help to guide your decision-making in advance, so that you can start with good practices in mind and avoid failures and frustrations.

"A data management plan describes the data that will be authored and how the data will be managed and made accessible throughout its lifetime."

Including:

- the types of data to be authored;
- the standards that would be applied, for example format and metadata content;
- provisions for archiving and preservation;
- access policies and provisions; and
- plans for eventual transition or termination of the data collection in the long-term future.

## Making decisions
A Data Management Plan doesn't need to be long, but it needs to cover relevant data management practices.

Often, Data Management Plans are aimed at grant agencies. In this case, writing a Data Management Plan is a matter of answering the right questions. Particular decisions may be more or less important to your research area or project, or a given grant agency may care about more or less about certain data management areas.

However, developing a Data Management Plan is a useful practice for yourself. Working on a Data Management Plan will force you to think through choices that will affect yourself and others in the future. If you write a Data Management Plan with your future self in mind, you'll respond to what a funding agency care about and more. 

- Initially Data Management Plans serve to aid thinking through how you will treat the data in your project. 
- Data Management Plans are also living documents that change as you work with the data over time. Adjusted to the realities of your project, a Data Management Plan serves as valuable documentation. You can refer to it when writing your thesis, dissertation, paper, and reuse parts in the future.

- Provide a brief description of the information to be gathered -- the nature, scope, and scale of the data that will be generated or collected.
- Are there existing data with a focus similar to the data that will be produced? If so, list what they are and explain why it is important to collect new data.
- Who will hold intellectual property rights for the data and other information created by the project?
	- Will these rights be transferred to another organization for data distribution and archiving? Will any copyrighted material (e.g., instruments or scales) be used? If so, how will the project obtain permission to use the materials and disseminate them?
- If applicable, how will you handle informed consent with respect to communicating to respondents that the information they provide will remain confidential when data are shared or made available for secondary analysis?
- Who will act as the responsible steward for the data throughout the data life cycle?
- What types of metadata will you produce to support the data? Will a metadata standard be used?
- How will the costs for creating data and documentation suitable for archiving be paid?
- Indicate how the data will be managed during the project, with information about version control, naming conventions, etc.
- How and where will you store copies of your research files to ensure their safety? How many copies will you maintain and how will you keep them synchronized?
- How will you ensure that the data are secure?
- Specify how you will ensure that the data meet quality assurance standards.
- Indicate how you intend to archive and share your data and why you have chosen that particular option.
	- Describe the audience for the data you will produce.
	- How will you ensure that data are preserved for the long term?
	- Specify the anticipated submission, distribution, and preservation formats for the data and related files (note that these formats may be the same).
	- Indicate how data will be selected for archiving, how long the data will be held, and what your plans are for eventual transition or termination of the data collection in the future.
	- Indicate whether any legal requirements apply to archiving and sharing your data.


### Exercise: Answering questions
- Which of the above questions does your example Data Management Plan answer? Which are omitted?
- Might any omitted information be be useful to know?
