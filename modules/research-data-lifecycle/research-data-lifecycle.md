# The research data lifecycle
<!-- Last revised: 2017-11-21

Revised by: Anna Dabrowski -->

Learning objectives:

- Participants recognize that research data have a "lifetime" or "lifecycle."

## Introduction
This section will introduce the data management perspective. 

As I mentioned earlier, in this series we will think about managing research data over time. 

Here, we'll talk about the life of research data to get an overview of data management concerns at different points during – and after – a research project. 

## The life of data
The “life”, “lifetime” or lifecycle” of research data covers the time from which a project is conceived and data gathering is planned, until the point when data are deleted, lost, or reused. 

When we discuss the data lifecycle, we’ll break it down into data management activities you will do at different parts of the research process. 

For our workshops, it is important to think about what happens to data in between research milestones like these. You will work with data in steps between the time:

- The research project is proposed.
- ...
- Research papers are published.
- ...
- The research project ends.
- ...
- Someone wants to reuse data.

## Diagrams as a tool
*Hand out pens and sheets of paper with sticky notes attached*

Diagrams – like the two empty flow charts you see here – are a great tool for thinking about the progress of your data over time. 

Before your research:

- Simple flow charts like these will give you an overview of the steps you expect the data in your project to go through, 
- and help you anticipate how the data will need to be managed at each step. 

Later in your research:

- As you work with your data, 
- more detailed flow charts can be valuable for effectively visualizing the specific decisions and actions you take to process data, and the results of those actions.

We'll discuss more detailed flow charts in a later section, right now, we'll focus on the overview before your project.

These two diagrams are empty, but:

- Each box can be filled in to show a data management stage as your research progresses.
- The arrows indicate the direction in which you move from one stage to another. 

## Exercise
Before we look at some examples of data lifecycle diagrams, I'd like you to take a few minutes to think about your research and how you expect it to progress.

You can think about an existing, or anticipated, research project.

You should have sheets of paper with your very own little yellow boxes in front of you.  

- Use the little post-it notes to represent steps in the life of your data, 
- go ahead and write the steps on the post-it notes, 
- and arrange them in the way you expect to move from one step to the next. 

What steps do you anticipate taking (or may have already taken) with data?

If it helps, you can start with step one being gather your research data.

- As write your step think about what your actions may be. 
- For example: what your form your data will take and how you will collect them.

You can end with deleting your data, or the step that you will take to make those data reusable for others after your project is complete.

As you think about your own research and how you will work with data, your diagrams can:

- take this sort of form, 
- they may also be simpler,
- or more complicated.

I'll give you 10 minutes or so to think and make diagrams before we talk about them. If you have any questions, just raise a hand.

*Ask participants to share diagrams*

This can be a tough thing to think through before we've talked more about the steps these diagrams often include. 
Since you may have more or less experience with research, I'd like to get an idea of how you currently think about your research data.

*If the exercise is unclear to a participant try the hint below*

### Hint 
For context, you can think about how the data changes. So, you:

- collect data and then you have **Raw data** 
- due to some actions this data becomes **Processed data** 
- then you start taking a look at the data have **Analyzed data** 
- You may need to do a bit more work with it before the data are **Finalized/published data**

To illustrate using a hypothetical research question:

Water temperatures in The Gulf of Mexico are now significantly warmer than in previous years. Is there evidence to link this to global warming?  

**Raw data** - These are the data generated during the research project.

- Raw data in our hypothetical research question might be daily measurements of temperature in the Gulf. 
- Raw data coincides with the data collecting step of the research data life cycle.

**Processed data** - How can the raw data be made useful/manipulable?

- Gulf temperature data may become processed by removing clearly erroneous temperature measurements from the data set, 
- and entering the remaining temperatures into a spreadsheet for manipulation and analysis. 
- Processed data coincides with the processing data step of the research data life cycle.

**Analyzed data** – What do the data tell us?  Is it significant?  How so?  

- Daily Gulf temperature data may be analyzed by finding average temperatures, looking at seasonal fluctuations, and generating graphs that demonstrate these changes.
- Analyzed data coincides with the analyzing data step of the research data lifecycle.

**Finalized/published data** – How does the data support your research question? 

- A plot of average Gulf temperatures for 2018 may show statistically significant differences when compared to the same data from 1913 and 1963.
- Finalized/published data coincides with a few sections of the research data lifecycle including preserving, giving access to, and re-using data.

Note: this Gulf temperature scenario is a very simplified example.  In many cases:

- Raw data from different sources will be collected, combined, and analyzed in support of a research question.  
- Data does not always flow simply from raw to published stages in a single, linear direction. 
- For example, raw data from one experiment may be repurposed for analysis in another.  
- Processed or raw data may also be subjected to multiple rounds of different methods of analysis.

## DataOne data lifecycle
The DataONE data life cycle has eight components:

- Plan: description of the data that will be compiled, and how the data will be managed and made accessible throughout its lifetime
- Collect: observations are made either by hand or with sensors or other instruments and the data are placed a into digital form
- Assure: the quality of the data are assured through checks and inspections
- Describe: data are accurately and thoroughly described using the appropriate metadata standards
- Preserve: data are submitted to an appropriate long-term archive (i.e. data center)
- Discover: potentially useful data are located and obtained, along with the relevant information about the data (metadata)
- Integrate: data from disparate sources are combined to form one homogeneous set of data that can be readily analyzed
- Analyze: data are analyzed

## DCC data curation lifecycle
The lifecycle focuses specifically on curation activities. 

- Conceptualise 
- Create or Receive
- Appraise and Select 
- Ingest
- Preservation Action
- Store 
- Access, Use and Reuse 
- Transform

## Simplified lifecycle
This workshop series will cover data management activities within stages of the data lifecycle.

1. Introduction to Research Data Management
2. Collect and document data
3. Store digital data
4. Work with data
5. Share and preserve data
6. Plan ahead

Since we're taking a lifecycle approach, we'll look at how practices at each stage impact later stages in the lifecycle. 

### Workshops

1. Introduction to Research Data Management
2. Collect and document data
3. Store digital data
4. Work with data
5. Share and preserve data
6. Plan ahead

This 6-week series provides an overview of research data management concepts. It covers good practices, tools, tips, and resources for effective management of digital data, including:

Data formatting for easy analysis.
File organization and naming conventions for identification.
Quality control for integrity.
Documentation and version control for tracking changes and roll-back.
Managing storage for security.
Back-up procedures for redundancy.
Policies for sharing and reuse.
Archiving and preservation for future accessibility
