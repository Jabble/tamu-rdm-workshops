# Working Collaboratively
## 2. 
- This is our final workshop.
- We'll talk primarily about writing plans for managing your research data.
- First I'd like to briefly introduce a useful tool to support collaborative work.

## 3. Introduction 
Goal: introduce OSF as a tool for working collaboratively on projects. 

It is worth setting up at the beginning of a project.

## 4. Open Science Framework
- You may already use Google Drive, Dropbox, NAS to collaborate and manage files.
- But your colleagues, or other collaborators may prefer to use different storage locations, and have their own practices.
- OSF is a general-purpose collaboration tool for researchers. 
- Aimed at allowing teams to work together and also improving research reproduciblity through open sharing of project materials. 

- Works like a centralized dashboard for:

	- Managing documents and access permissions across parts of a project.

Users store documents directly in OSF or integrates with third-party services:

- Github
- Dropbox
- Google Drive
- FigShare
- Data repositories like our institutional one.

Project can be private, restrict access to collaborators, or shared publically.

## 5. Demo
Example OSF Project [Page](https://osf.io/nzx9q/)

- Areas of a project page:
	- Public/Private
		- Choice
	- Metadata
		- Project contributors
		- Descriptive information entered by researchers
		- License for reuse
	- Files
		- Upload and download files to/from OSF storage
		- Connect to accounts in other storage services (GitHub, Google Drive, Dropbox)
		- Look at file
	- Citation
		- Automatically generated
	- Project components 
		- Project is organized into components by the researchers
		- Different contributers can be included per component
		- read, read/write, or admin permissions
	- Activity Log
		- Tracks changes made in the project
