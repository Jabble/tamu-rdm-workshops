# Working Collaboratively
## Objectives
- Introduce one useful tool for working collaboratively on projects

##
- May already use Google Drive, Dropbox to share and manage files.
- We mentioned Lab notebooks that can help you manage procedures and workflows in a lab setting
- And we mentioned using workflows in your documentation as a way to show others how you did your analysis and processed data. Some of these can even be executable. 
	- This may be a way of collaborating.
- There are more general-purpose collaboration tools

## Tools
- Open Science Framework
